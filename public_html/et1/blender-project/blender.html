    <p>For this project, I designed the character model for moomin, the one who jumps out of the egg. I also animated his movements, like jumping out of the egg (my other teammates also helped contribute to this part as well) and doing his little hops at the end. I tried giving him armatures, which ended up taking up most of my time, which ultimately I scrapped. Though, despite the challenges I'm so happy with how adorable it turned out, considering it was our first time animating. <3</p>
